        <p>Hi, My name is Sean and I'm a 20 year old born on September 2<sup>nd</sup> 2004. I'm an undergraduate studying <strong>Interactive Media Design.</strong> What I aim to get out of this course is <strong>motion graphics</strong> and <strong>graphic designing</strong>. So far I'm enjoying the course; although there are so much assignments and some topics are a little hard to understand but nonetheless i'm ready for the challenge. </p>
        <p>In terms of character, I'm a quiet and observant person, I don't like to be the center of attention as it makes me extremely nervous. I love to play video games and my most favorites are: <strong>Yakuza</strong> and <strong>Team Fortress 2</strong> or <abbr title="Team Fortress 2">TF2</abbr> as it's popularly known. I hope that i'm able to excel in this course for the rest of this year and the years to come. </p>
